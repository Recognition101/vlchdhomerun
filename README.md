# VLC HDHomeRun Listings

This is a very simple web-app that lets you input the local IP address of an [HD Home Run](http://hdhomerun.com) device to list all available channels, along with four links per channel:

1. **VLC (720p)** - This link, when clicked on an iOS device with VLC installed, will open VLC and stream the channel at 720p.
2. **VLC (1080p)** - This link opens a 1080p stream for the channel in iOS VLC.
3. **Raw (720p)** - This is the raw 720p channel streaming link, useful to copy and paste into desktop VLC.
4. **Raw (1080p)** - This is the raw 1080p channel streaming link.
